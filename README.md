# Deep and Transfer Learning with Resnet18 and U-Net++

## Description:

In this project, I used an Ants and Bees dataset to perform transfer learning using Resnet18 and U-Net++ for image classification. Using torchvision transforms I carried out some transformations on the images. I also normalized them with mean and standard deviation. Using a defining "def" a "train_model()" fuction, I wrote a code to handle several operations that the Resnet18 architecture supports. The accuracy of the Resnet18 model was 94%.

using U-Net++ for Image Segmentation: Currnently learing about the insteresting architecture of U-Net++. Unlike U-Net, It introduces dense skip pathways between encoder and decoder blocks to improve feature propagation, enhance gradient flow, and help capture more intricate details. Essentially, U-Net++ has additional skip connections between the encoder and decoder at each level, creating a series of nested paths.
